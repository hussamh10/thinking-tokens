Ivan Fyodorivich, presented as an intellectual who while argues and debates on theological philosophy, is actually, behind a veil, an atheist. 

He argues, without the belief in immortality, there cannot exist morality. Rather, he extends, without the belief in immortality, crime must be permissibleâ€”even celebrated. 

What I imagine Vanya means by immortality here is the belief in after life, the possibility of judgement. It is unclear whether he is also suggesting that in a world without immortality  God does not exist and since (his claim:) that morality requires a God, there can not be morality without immortality. 

One interpretation of this claim is similar to this one thought experiment where imagine someone A (even yourself) is trapped on an island with someone else B. A murders B. Did A do anything wrong?

There are not many clear arguments that justify why what A did was wrong especially if you are coming from a non-virtue morality. In the contexts of legality, it is right. In subjectivism, it is right. If there is no judgement, no judge, how was killing B wrong? If you are not held accountable (through immoratility) how was what you did wrong?
