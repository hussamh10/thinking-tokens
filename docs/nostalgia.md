`mumkin nahi ha waqt ki raftaar rok lein `

Why does time only move forward? We have all come to expect this of time. It marches forward, meeting a cause to its consequence. Left alone to its devices, time would only spread disorder, rotting all meaning and order in the universe. We are on a losing battle against time, the name you wrote on the beach sand was, adding meaning to the world from meaningless blocks, only to lose the meaning again. What would life be like, if instead, time moved backwards. What if meaning was always in our lives, our memories, only for us to take it all in one last time, collapsing, never to exist again.

We come into this world empty, unaware, and purposeless. It takes a lifetime to build our existence. Closely examining a life, you can see the musical nature of it with no goal at the end only crescendos and silences placed in the middle. But yet, song only plays in one direction. You descend in a new body, a clear mind. Void of any assumptions, expectations, traumas, and triumphs. You collect each in your helpless years, one by one. You expectations from life grow to extremes, everything seems possible and so small. You meet people and make friends out of them over tireless years. Collecting memories rushing towards your older self bursting to show everything you have seen. You uncover the truths of life slowly, learn the realities of being a human, accept the nature of time, gradually taking away your ambitions in return for comfort and safety. The same parade of time that carved the canyons you've hiked chip away on your bones taken an ounce of youth each year until the year when you have nothing more to give. The final days when you finally sit down and listen to the story of your life, now understanding what each day meant, reliving each memory until it fades away. 

You appear in this world, all knowing, wise. Years of untangling have left you with a ball of string—tidier but frayed. Decades of mastery of reason, discipline, and ripping holes in your soul. 

When you didn't know better, your younger self as itself, would escape in work, lie profusely, trust naively, and forget without thought, something you had to slowly rip away from yourself. But time moves backwards here. You are defined and complete, not thrown into this life blank and unwritten. Fully realized and existing. Your life has meaning, one that takes years to craft. But this time, your purpose is to slowly undo things, let go of your self. 

You enter relationships knowing everything that is wrong about it yet driven by love. 

The youth is wasted on the young. 
- Not defined by who you are.
- You slowly undo the things.
- You take worn out things only to give them back a new.
- It does seem like the behavior of young people is more driven by impulse and is less calculated. An older 40 yr old person crossing a street seems to be a calculated behavior but a 20yr its the true nature. The decisions of an older individual are more calculated and less impulsive. You gain your nature and lose your inner perosnalied
# Reverse.
- Moving back in time. 
- Logistics. 
	- You start old, tired, weak, and slow.
	- Wise, brittle, content, and sure.
	- You spend time thinking about your past regrets memories that you are rushing towards. 
	- You long for energy, to learn to forget.
	- You become unsure, restless, your plan gets grander. You become ambitious. 
	- And this time its not your bones that let go of your dreams, its because you truly learn to live in the moment that you let go of your dreams when they are at their brightest, never to think of them again, never to regret them
- What are the benefits. 
- Experiences. 
	- Things are most sweet at the end. You begin from there. 
	- Beginning a hike, full of the energy of what you have seen going back to look and forget one more time.
- People
	- You count down days for
