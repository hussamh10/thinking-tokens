This book is about the Karamzov family.

**Character notes**
- **Fyodor** is described as a man who ended up in a lot of wealth but lacked common sense and decency. The most salient feature of his personality, that possibly surfaced his sensualism and debauchery, is being performative—specifically as a buffoon. This is made apparent in how after his loveless marriage, the author mentions, it almost feels he was delighted, once again, to be relegated to the role of a buffoon. The concept of acting and performance is repeated once again when describing his relationship with Mitya (Dimitry). 
	- Fyodor is not a traditional father figure.
	- Sensual and driven by impulses. 
	- Performative. 
  
- **Dimitry** is the first child of Fyodor, completely neglected and often forgotten by his father and abandoned by his mother. Dimitry's initial caretaker was a circumstancial one, Grigory, the only person who had any knowledge of his existence. A year later, another man, Pyotr, from his mother's side, took in charge of Dimitry. But Pyotr too abandoned Dimitry and leaving him in the care of one of his aunts. She too abandoned (died) him and changed homes again. The abandonment was repeated once again for the sixth time. 
	- Had not have a stable home.
	- Abandoned six times. 
	- Had no mother or father figure—or at least none mentioned.
	- Also impulsive (racking debts, dropping out of school).

- **Sofya** is Fyodor's second wife. She was an orphan and tormented by her guardian. It is important to note, for a future references, that Fyodor married her because of her beauty but he recognized that he had saved her from the torment and hence she was *guilty* in front of her. She was also a shrieker, there isn't much explanation of this condition other than the self-explanatory word. 

- **Grigory** is Fyodor's house keeper. So far we have been told about his selfless acts in taking care of all three of the brothers, even at the face of humiliation. 
  
- **Ivan** the middle Karamzov. 

- **Aleksy**
