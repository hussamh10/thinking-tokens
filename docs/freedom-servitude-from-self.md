> In the fifth chapter Elders, when describing what elders are and how the concept was introduced from the East to Russia, Dostoevsky makes an intriguing remark. In the beginning, he says that students come to elders and become *obedient*—to an extreme—to achieve freedom from self. At the end, he remarks that they must remain cautious during the process of obedience as to not fall for the most satanic pride: servitude. 

> [!Summary] 
> Freedom and servitude are not virtues in themselves, rather they require some referent to exist. The virtue and morality lies in the morality of the referent. Theologists strive for freedom from self desires and servitude to a divinity where as atheist existentialists strive for servitude to a true self and freedom from meaning and purpose. 

Freedom and servitude although seem as virtues, they are rather shallow than we think, mere word plays. FMD says that one must show full obedience to the *elders*, so that they may achieve freedom from self. I imagine here the self here is referring to the person's desires. Desires that he may be submitting to beforehand. However, in religions like Islam, Christianity, and even in the elders obedience, there is the idea of submitting to someone greater than you (God). Submitting and serving knowing it as your only purpose. 

The difference in freedom and servitude is further blurred as you bring the lack-of-free-will.md into the conversation. There has to be some point at which *you* are submitting. To make my argument that both freedom and servitude are the same things: 

A free man will be serving to a higher order, God, elders, morals. Where as a non-free man according to Dostoevesky will be serving to his own *self*. 

Another interesting thing is how existensialism, while promping freedom is still talking about serving your self. While arguably the self is different there, it is still to know who you are and show immense authenticity to itself. 

In traditional religion, it is the alternative, where we take a leap of faith *away* from realism (observational knowledge) and submit to the diving commands, teachings etc. While from what I understand, existential religion is essentially you are a realist and a believer?

Following this thought, what does it mean then to live an authentic life. Where does the authentic self come from. Is there an authentic Hussam that is either buried beneath my body and mind or a Hussam that is external to me that I am reaching towards that is my essence.
