**Summary**
This takes a few turns and drops some easter eggs. The first half is dedicated to two ideas: how pious and good were the people selected as prophets and how God was in charge of changing their lives. Specifically, how God granted them offspring (Hz Zakaria and Hz Maryum) from nothing. The next part talks about who will go to Hell and who to Heaven. 

### Evil
There are some verses here that play with the idea of evil, wrong doing, and disbelievers. I imagine the concept of disbelievers is quite straightforward—those who do not believe but what is difficult is the idea of evil. In one ayat, it is said: 

> *What suffering will come to those who obscure the truth when a dreadful Day arrives!* (19:37).

 This hints that bad might be more related to intention of doing wrong—knowing what is wrong and still doing it (obscuring the truth). However, a new idea of evil is introduced as people who are driven by their own desires:

> but there came after them generations who neglected prayer and were driven by their own desires. These will come face to face with their evil... (19:59)

This suggests that own desires are something to be gotten rid of—impure and not desirable morally. 

Another interesting note is, when talking about disbelievers, it is said:

> but these gods will reject their worship and will even turn against them.

While there is no god but God, it is curious to think what these gods are referred to as? Are they worldly concepts that replace our devotion to God? (money, power, beauty, etc.)? Or could this be about actual false gods that do not exist at all—but how will they then *turn* against?
### God's offspring.

Two times in this Surah, I imagine because of narratives where a son is born without any consummation, it is clarified that God does not have a child.

> it would not befit God to have a child. He is far above that: when He decrees something, He says only, ‘Be,’ and it is. (19:35)

> The disbelievers say, ‘The Lord of Mercy has offspring.’ How terrible is this thing you assert: it almost causes the heavens to be torn apart, the earth to split asunder, the mountains to crumble to pieces, that they attribute offspring to the Lord of Mercy. It does not befit the Lord of Mercy to have offspring. (19:88-92)

I would like to understand how it is obvious that it does not *befit* God to have a child. Whatever the reason, it does not seem trivial.

### Heaven and Hell.

The Surah also delves into a bit of description of the heaven and hell, however, I am interested in the criteria for entering either. While the overarching idea is that evil is for hell and good for heaven, the following Surah's make the criteria at least a bit more invovled—specifically playing with the idea of free will and ability to change oneself. 


> Have you [Prophet] not seen how We send devils to incite the disbelievers to sin? (19:83)

> But God gives more guidance to those who are guided, and good deeds of lasting merit are best and most rewarding in your Lord’s sight. (19:76)

While these verses do not disqualify the idea of free will, they do propose a feedback loop of nudges that show how taking steps towards a certain direction makes it easier to keep going towards that direction. Maybe that is the challenge altogether?

> We shall seize out of each group those who were most disobedient towards the Lord of Mercy- (19:69)
> We know best who most deserves to burn in Hell- (19:70)

These often appear paradoxical (disobedient → lord of mercy). While there are abundant mentions of mercy and opportunity to repent, this framing structure often leads the reader (at least me) surprised. These verses must be more involved than what they seem initially. 

> and drive the sinful like a thirsty herd into Hell, (19:86)

This just seems more aligned with friedrich-nietzsche.md remark of contemptuous morality, where a wrong doer is punished as a means of vengeance. However, it is likely that these are merely tools to illustrate the wrongness of a deed and warn the wrong doers
